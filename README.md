# Front-end with Angular

We will explore the folders and files created by the Angular CLI. And by building a simple application, we will study the key concepts of angular: Components, Data Binding, Directives and Service.

Components are used to control the different views that we use in a web app. A component consists of a controller class written in TypeScript and the view template.

For coordinating the controlling class with the view template, angular offers different ways of data binding. Typically, data stored in a class property is rendered in a view template and when an event raised in the template is sent back to the controlling class to be handled by a class method. 

Sometimes, simple data binding is not enough, for example, if we want to render an entire array as an HTML list, for situations like that where we need to generate or manipulate DOM elements, we use one of the angularsâ€™ built-in directives. 

As mentioned already the task of the component class is to control the view. All the logic needed to control the behavior of the related view template should be part of the class. On the other hand, everything which is not directly related to the view and requires substantial coding and resources should be moved into a separate class called a service. As an example, the service could be responsible for requesting data from the server and a component class would consume the service to load the data and render it in the view template.

## Using the Angular CLI to setup an Angular Application

To see these concepts in practice, first create a new empty folder on your machine to store your first angular app and switch over to VSCode and open the folder created.

Install the Angular CLI globally `npm install @angular/cli -g`, the Angular CLI is a tool which makes it easy to create new angular applications, setting up the development environment and also assisting in common angular tasks like creating new components or services.

Create a new angular project by the command "ng new" followed by the "name-of-the-app" `ng new books-app`.

When the setup is done navigate into the app folder by using the command `cd books-app` in the terminal window. Then, we are ready to run the application with the CLI command `ng serve`. The server will be started and the app will be available locally on port 4200 (http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Within the app's main folder books-app, there are three sub folders and a couple of configuration files. The e2e folder is for testing purposes. The node_modules folder contains all the node modules angular depends on. The src folder contains the source code for the app.

Within the src folder, we find the file index.html which is the html shown in the browser. The file contains a simple HTML boilerplate, and the body of this HTML consists of nothing more than a custom tag called app-root.

app-root refers to the root component which is found in the "src/app" folder. The component is called here app component and the main file is "app.component.ts". This file contains the controller class which is basically just an ordinary TypeScript class but with metadata attached through a class decorator. The selector 'app-root' is used to include the component in an HTML file, in a case of the root component, we saw it was included in the index.html file. And we have references to the HTML template and CSS stylesheet belonging to the component.

## BooksApp!

Let's proceed creating a simple books app which shows a list of books. To start, we need a model for the books data. In the folder app, create a sub folder model and in there create a file book.ts, exporting a class Book containing properties like the title, a list of authors and coverImage.

```TypeScript
export class Book {
    title: string
    authors: string[]
    coverImage: string
}
```

The Book class is then imported in the app component.

```TypeScript
import { Book } from './model/book';
```

In a first step, we will provide some test data directly in the component class. For that, create a property books which is an array of books and add some data manually.

We could take the data from [google books api](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes), there you will find an example for a get request for searching book volumes, copy this [link](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms) into the browser's address bar and modify it to search for books written by Alex Garland, to this end set the search string q to inauthor:"Alex Garland" and add a second property langRestrict to restrict search results to the English language. After submitting the get request/[modified link](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=inauthor:"Alex Garland"&langRestrict=en), you should see the results in JSON format on the screen. Now copy the relevant data; title, author and thumbnail from a few results and use it to generate some test data.

In the component's template, Add a unordered list and include just one element for the beginning corrsspoding to the first entry in the books array. To display the data in a template we use what is called interpolation, for that we place the relevant properties from the component class within double curly braces.

```HTML
{{ books[0].authors[0] }} <strong>{{ books[0].title }}</strong>
```

Interpolation is one of the four ways of data binding in angular. Data binding is a convieninet mechanism for coordinating the controlling class with the view template. In this case, we push data from the class into the HTML template.

Beside interpolation, there is another way to push data from the class into the HTML, which is called property binding. With property binding we can bind a DOM property to a property in the component class. In our case we add an image tag and bind the src property to the thumbnail link which is part of our test data in the component class. To bind the DOM property src, enclose it in square brackets and set it to the property coverImage. Moreover, add some CSS class.

```HTML
<img [src]="books[0].coverImage" class="preview">
```

So right now, we control which image is shown by binding the DOM's property src, But we don't have control over the class property yet. To get control over it we can use the class property binding which is a special kind of property binding. Again we use square brackets, and within the square brackets we qualify the class by [class.className] in our case [class.preview] and set it to a Boolean value, let's say "previewMode" defined in the component class.

```HTML
 <img [src]="books[0].coverImage" [class.preview]="previewMode">
```
by setting previewMode to true, we have the same situation as before, the preview class is always on, with the difference that we can now toggle the class based on some logic within the component. For example, we could toggle the preview class when we click on the image. To implement a click handler, we use angular's event binding which is again another way of data binding. However, data flows not from the class into the HTML but goes the opposite direction. The event originating in the view is propagated to the class and handled by a class method. For implementing the event binding, we enclose the event in ordinary round brackets and set it to the class method used to handle the event. Here we call the class method onClickImage and define that method in the component class.

```HTML
<img [src]="books[0].coverImage" [class.preview]="previewMode" (click) ="onClickImage()">
```

At this point, we learned about three of the four fundamental ways of data binding in angular; interpolation and property binding where data is pushed from the class into the HTML and event binding where the data flows the opposite direction from the view to the component class. The remaining type is two-way binding, where data flows in both directions and in which we will come across later.
